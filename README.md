## Inspiration
We wanted to have a strong use case of soul-bound tokens. We searched around KYCs and some other use cases, and then we decided to make these Soulbound tokens as the proof for the qualification of any course showing the person’s calibre in the skill.

## What it does
It provides a unique random ID for each certification.

## How we built it
We built it using chainlink VRF.

## Challenges we ran into
Understanding Chainlink’s features and how to use them in actual projects. The documentation was just good for getting an idea, but implementing the chain link was very challenging. Deciding what SoulBound tokens to use was challenging, and not having enough documentation around it was more challenging.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We understood the learning of chainlink VRF.
We understood the importance of time-constraint.

## What we learned
Chainlink Usage
Time Management

## What's next for Educational_dSBT
To build it on a different level and bring it to the world as a learning platform.
